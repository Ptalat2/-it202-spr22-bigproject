Testing For Marking Util APP

1.  good-Feedback: The data screen and the userInput screen both did a great job in showcasing the strengths of google maps.
    This app was very user friendly and easy to use. I loved the the voice features because it allowed the app be more interactive.

2.  negative-criticism: The voice-inputted-markers page's dark and light mode makes it hard to see the text box for typing the longitude and latitude values.

3.  resolution: So I got rid of the dark mode in the voice-inputted-markers page.

User-Testing:

Some user testing I did was for the userInput screen I got all the longitude and latitude values for country's and I plotted them.
This allowed me to see if my app could plot multiple markers or not.

For screen two(the Api inputted markers) I tested it on multiple country's', and my screen did plot those. Since this app screen does not put a marker on all the country's in the world, I added an alert to inform the user if the country is not found.

For screen three(Voice inputted markers) the functionality was the same as screen one but this time the user states there longitude and latitude values through audio, and then by clicking the appropriate buttons the user sees there location marked on the map.

Lastly, the data page took the most work, I fetch an api that contains data for schools around the world. Then the data is stored into the indexDB, and then retrieved and manipulated to mark the selected dropdown school through a form. When the school is chosen the map will get marker for it, and if you click the marker it will give you thr school name. Futhermore, when the marker is placed on the map, the device will speak to you the school name and its phone number if interested.
